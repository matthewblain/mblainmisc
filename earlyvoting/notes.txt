Early Voting Map.

Goal: Make a map so voters can find an early voting polling place convenient to
both their time and location.


These are some rough notes I made for myself while making this.

Data source:

Open Excel file from dept of elections 
 https://www.washoecounty.us/voters/electioninformation/evschedule.php
Copy paste it to reformat it that the two weeks are on one row
Move dates down into the day -of-week cells
Delete first row
Save as CSV -- data/2016_general_early_voting_schedule.csv


First attempt: 

Let's just reformat it so it's basically the same structure (row=polling place; columns=one per day of hours):

sed hackery to make 'open' and 'closing' columns; i was going to do this python but decied this was quicker. it's also not very clever, nor pipelined since it was semi-interactive


sed 's/\([0-9]\{1,2\}\) a.m. - \([0-9]\{1,2\}\) p.m./\1,\2/g' < 2016_general_early_voting_schedule.csv > parsed.csv

sed 's/\(1[0-9]\/[0-9]\{1,2\}\/2016\)/\1 open,\1 close/g' < parsed.csv > parsed2.csv

sed 's/CLOSED/&,&/g' < parsed2.csv > parsed3.csv

open spreadsheet, add min/max calculation to each to get an idea of what's going on.

excel's outlier feature would be great here, but i'm using libreoffice.

Result: 
parsed3.csv aka polling_locations_open_close_columns.csv

upload parsed3 (w/o calculations) to cartodb.

georeference address column


Little diversion for future easy of use w/carto:
 Add some georeferenced data back to the CSV
 Re-download the CSV from cartodb. Check that the rows match (order wise). Copy and paste the the_geom column back into the CSV.

Make some maps...

Tried a few things, including torque (carto's time lapse magic).

hahah what a mess. trying to figure out torque.

alternatives: https://github.com/skeate/Leaflet.timeline, https://github.com/hallahan/LeafletPlayback . but let's stick w/the hosted sol'n for now.


Retry... let's reformat this so Torque can actually use this.

Carto and Torque didn't handle the event-per-column thing very well, though that mechanism
probably actually works for a multi-layer map OK.


Reformat to a series of Events instead...

Created columnsplitter.py. A basic CSV reader/writer which will write a single row
for every open and every close time in the original sheet which referenced an open set of hours. 
It uses 1 and -1 for those so that summing them over time tells you if the place is open or closed.

Uploaded to carto; the torque library still didn't quite work right, even with
experiments around changing the settings:

-torque-time-attribute:"event_time";
-torque-aggregation-function:"sum(openclose)";
-torque-resolution:2;
-torque-data-aggregation:cumulative;


Next step: 
Let's try some local leaflet/cartodb.js stuff.
Playing with the tutorial at https://carto.com/docs/tutorials/create_map_cartodbjs/
Created cartodbjs_pages based on that.
reno_early_voting.html is based on tutorial1_finished.
